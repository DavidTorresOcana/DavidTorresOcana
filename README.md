I am a robotics and computer vision engineer with over a decade of experience in autonomous systems, spanning defense, aerial vehicles, and, more recently, Automated Driving (AD). My journey has been defined by determination, curiosity, and a strong work ethic driven by a commitment to lifelong learning and self-improvement.

Specializing in camera-based perception and state estimation, I have developed algorithms for AD perception, ground robots and aerial vehicles. My competencies includes visual (inertial) odometry, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and multi-sensor calibration, all underpinned by a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and computer vision. Proficient in Python, C++, ROS, and machine learning frameworks, I thrive on solving complex challenges that advance the field of intelligent systems.

I am passionate about contributing to projects that push boundaries in robotics and autonomous systems and look forward to opportunities to bring impactful innovations to life.

Main research topics iterests: computer vision, SLAM, geometry and machine learning for robotics and autonomous driving
